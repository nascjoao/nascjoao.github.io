Welcome back to my website!\
As you can see, things are different here, again.

I&apos;ve been pretty tired of social media. Wanted to start something new and
then I thought it would be fun to care about my own space on the internet.

Previously, this used to be a business card website, with just a few links.
Now, I&apos;m excited to turn it into a more personal and expressive space.

Hence, beyond the professional aspects, you can expect to see more personal
projects, thoughts, and experiments showcased here.\
(even those experiments I do in the kitchen)

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to reach out if you want to connect!
