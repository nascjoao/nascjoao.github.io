## Now I have a blog

This is not my first time having a blog, but now I actually mean it.\
As I wrote [in my last post](/blog/2025/welcome-back), I'm pretty tired of social media and want to dedicate more time on my own space. I want to share my thoughts, ideas, and projects in my own way.

### My space is not a project, it's my corner of the internet 

Building this website is being a fun experience. I'm incrementing it little by little, as I miss features or want to improve something.\
Differently from any other project I have, this one is almost a therapeutic activity for me.

So, I don't have any deadlines or roadmaps. I'll just keep improving it as I go.

It doesn't mean I'm closed to suggestions, though! Actually, I appreciate any feedback you may have.
You can open an issue on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/nascjoao/nascjoao.github.io/issues) or send an email to me at <a href="mailto:oi@nasc.dev">oi@nasc.dev</a>.

No much more to say for now.\
See you around!
